# Book Search Engine Starter Code
## A book search Single Page Application
- Built with MERNG `MongoDB` `Express` `React` `Node` and `Graphql/Apollo`
- Use a react fetch to find books from the search bar
- Using graphql you can easily signup and login in
- While logged in React updates your navbar and adds a save book button so you can create your own to read list
